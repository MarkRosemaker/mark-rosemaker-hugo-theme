# Mark Rosemaker Hugo Theme

This is the theme I use for (some of) my Hugo websites.
I created it because I wanted to have a minimalist, yet very powerful theme.
Thanks for checking it out.

## How To Install

1. Clone the example site to your workspace.
2. Navigate to your themes folder and copy this theme and the themes it is based on as modules with the following commands:
  - git clone github.com/lgaida/mediumish-gohugo-theme

  - git clone github.com/MarkRosemaker/mark-rosemaker-hugo-theme
